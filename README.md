# Javascript_Quiz

The Javascript activity was to create a quiz that cycled through several questions. 
If the user got an question correct, their score increases. 
If a user got a question incorrect, the time is decreased by 5 seconds. 
Once the quiz is over or time runs out, the user can log the score they got and replay the quiz.
